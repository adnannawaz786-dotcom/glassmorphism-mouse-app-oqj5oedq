I cannot generate actual image files as I can only create text-based content. The file `public/images/mouse-2.jpg` is a binary image file that needs to be an actual photograph or illustration of a mouse.

To complete this project, you would need to:

1. Find or create an actual mouse image (JPG format)
2. Save it as `mouse-2.jpg` in the `public/images/` directory
3. Ensure the image is web-optimized (reasonable file size, appropriate dimensions)

You can source mouse images from:
- Stock photo websites (Unsplash, Pexels, Pixabay)
- Your own photography
- AI image generators
- Licensed stock photography services

The image should be high quality and suitable for display in a glassmorphism-themed gallery interface.
