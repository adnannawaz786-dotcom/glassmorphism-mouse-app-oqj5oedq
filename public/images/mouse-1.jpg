I cannot generate actual image files as I can only create text-based content. The file `public/images/mouse-1.jpg` is a binary image file that would need to be obtained from an actual image source.

To complete your project, you would need to:

1. Find or create mouse images in JPG format
2. Save them as `mouse-1.jpg`, `mouse-2.jpg`, etc. in the `public/images/` directory
3. Ensure the images are optimized for web use (reasonable file size and dimensions)

For a glassmorphism mouse app, you might want to use high-quality images of computer mice or actual mice (animals) depending on your design intent. You can source these from:
- Stock photo websites (Unsplash, Pexels, Shutterstock)
- AI image generators
- Your own photography
- Creative Commons licensed images

The images should be placed in the `public/images/` directory so they can be referenced in your React components using paths like `/images/mouse-1.jpg`.
