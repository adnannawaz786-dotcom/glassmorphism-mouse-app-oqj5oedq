I cannot generate actual image files as I can only create text-based content. The file `public/images/mouse-hero.jpg` is a binary image file that needs to be either:

1. Downloaded from a stock photo website
2. Created using image editing software
3. Generated using AI image generation tools
4. Sourced from free image repositories like Unsplash or Pexels

For this glassmorphism mouse app, you would need a high-quality image of a mouse (computer mouse or animal mouse based on your preference) that serves as the hero image for the home page.

To obtain this file, I recommend:
- Searching for "mouse hero image" on Unsplash.com
- Using AI image generators like DALL-E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion
- Purchasing from stock photo sites like Shutterstock
- Taking/creating your own mouse photograph

The image should be optimized for web use (preferably under 500KB) and have dimensions suitable for a hero section (e.g., 1920x1080 or similar aspect ratio).
